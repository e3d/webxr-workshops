# Introduction to WebXR 


This workshop covers the basics of what WebXR is and how to use AFrame to build and test simple scenes.
For someone with a little programming experience they can complete this in 30 min or less by themselves. For children or people with no programming experience at all, this workshop is better
run as a group lesson and could take an hour or more.
